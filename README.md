## Importing project from VCS (Using IntelliJ)
IntelliJ has built-in support for importing projects directly from Version Control Systems (VCS) like GitLab.
To download and import your project:

- Launch IntelliJ and chose `Get from VCS` from the start-up window.
- Input the url of your project e.g. `https://eng-git.canterbury.ac.nz/seng202-2022/team-X`.

**Note:** *If you run into dependency issues when running the app or the Maven pop up doesn't appear then open the Maven sidebar and click the Refresh icon labeled 'Reimport All Maven Projects'.*

## Importing Project from a folder (Using IntelliJ)
IntelliJ has built-in support for Maven (although if you turned the Maven plugin off when you were setting it up
youâ€™ll need to re-enable it). To import your project:

- Launch IntelliJ and choose `Open` from the start-up window.
- Select the project folder.
- Select `Import project from external model` and make sure that `Maven is highlighted.

**Note:** *If you run into dependency issues when running the app or the Maven pop up doesn't appear then open the Maven sidebar and click the Refresh icon labeled 'Reimport All Maven Projects'.*

## Build Project
- Open a command line interface inside the project directory and run `mvn clean package` to build a .jar file. The file is located at target/revolt-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
- Alternatively you can run mvn `mvn clean package -P headlessTests`. This will build the .jar file with TestFX running in the background instead of requiring you to not move your mouse while it runs

## Run App
- If you haven't already, Build the project.
- Open a command line interface inside the project directory and run `cd target` to change into the target directory.
- Run the command `java -jar revolt-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` to open the application.
- If this fails in Intellij go to edit configurations then the plus sign or add configuration
- Then click maven and then in command line type javafx:run and then apply
- run the configuration

## Testing
1. Open a command line interface inside the project directory and run `mvn test` to run all tests.

## Javadoc
1. Open a command line interface inside the project directory and run `mvn javadoc:jar` to generate a folder of javadoc. The folder is located at target/apidocs
